                <h2>The Foundation</h2>
                <p>Pursuit of Excellence, LLC, was started in a one-bedroom apartment in Metuchen, New Jersey in 2005, approximately,
                    as an active investment vehicle for the founder, Ihsan Muhammad. While still in college, Muhammad decided to learn the fundamentals of stock market investing, 
                    and began to invest his personal funds through Pursuit of Excellence. During this time also, Mr. Muhammad would constantly read books on the topics of Financial Literacy, Self-Improvement, and Business Strategy, 
                    including "Rich-Dad, Poor-Dad", Who ate my cheese", "The Art of the Deal", and many other business publications. Mr. Muhammad also auditioned to be a contestant on the show, The Apprentice, as an apprentice of Donald Trump,
                    and his goals began to form to, "Achieve Excellence", in business, and life. Mr. Muhammad knew that he wanted to achieve a high-level of success, and make an impact in the business world, like other renown business leaders before him, but he did not know the road to take to reach his goals. As Mr. Muhammad continued to live his life, being a husband, father, and son, his desire to pursue excellence and thrive in the business arena never left him.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <h2>The Inflection Point</h2>
                    <p>Once in 2011, approximately, his wife questioned him about what he wanted to do in life, and he responded, "To run a Global hedge fund!" Mr. Muhammad never ended up working on Wall Street, but as the middle of the 2010s approached, Mr. Muhammad began noticing 
                    that small firms located in Silicon Valley, and focused on technology, began to earn profits similar to companies, which were significantly larger than them, and that were much older establishments.
                    Observing this trend, Mr. Muhammad began reading, and learning more about technology companies, and what made them, "so special". By 2015-2016, Mr. Muhammad had renewed his interests in business, but now his attention was focused on starting a technology oriented business. One observation that Mr. Muhammad noticed was that all of the founders
                    of the tech companies that he had learned of all knew how to code. While Mr. Muhammad did not know how to code, this did not deter him, and he continued to seek avenues into the tech field. Mr. Muhammad worked for some time as a lighing technician, where he learned about wiring ballasts, and other electrical wiring knowledge. Mr. Muhammad also enrolled and completed 
                    a bootcamp that taught the Salesforce platform. Mr. Muhammad then enrolled in a Java/SDLC bootcamp, but he did not complete the program.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    <h2>Where We are Today</h2>
                    <p> Mr. Muhammad was not deterred, and after the pandemic of 2020, Mr. Muhammad tried his hand in business again, and started a laundry drop-off and pickup service business in the Philadelphia area. While this was a great 
                    learning opportunity for Mr. Muhammad, this, as well as some of the other businesses that Mr. Muhammad pursued did not leave him fulfilled, and of the opinion that he had found his purpose in life. After continuing to work different jobs in the Philadelphia area,
                    Mr. Muhammad was referred to Generation USA's bootcamp in the fall of 2021, and chose the Full-Stack Web Developer prorgam. Mr. Muhammad finally had an opportunity to learn how to code, so that he could fulfill his dream to get into the tech field, and eventually move on to found a global technology company. While enrolled in the program, Mr. Muhammad was fortunate to be accepted into 
                    McKinsey's Software Engineering Apprenticeship, which began in March 2022, and as part of the apprenticeship, he is enrolled in Multiverse's Software Engineering Bootcamp, which is helping train and prepare him for his role as a Software
                    Engineer at McKinsey & Company. In Mr. Muhammad's spare time, he plans to learn the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, the Internet-of-Things, as well as Robotics, so that he can build products and software to helps solve challenges in urban transportation and infrastructure, search-and-rescue missions, crime,
                    construction projects, and many other challenges that we face on a daily basis. This is the history of Pursuit of Excellence Technologies, and We are not defined by our circumstances, but rather We are dedicated to thriving in any and every environment!</p>
